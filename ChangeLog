CHANGES SINCE 0.9.2

- When reading multiple files, malloc complained when freeing memory.  Using
  alloca now instead, which does not complain (although it may seem a buffer
  overrun is lurking somewhere).

- Not using exit(), using return codes.  If error occurs, we always stop.

- Using `cat file.jpg | jp2a -' now does not print help message along with
  image.


CHANGES SINCE 0.9.1

- Much better output results, due to more accurate normalization and removal of
  missing scanlines in output image.

- Default mode is now "--width=70" instead of "--size=80x25", as this preserves
  JPEG aspect ratio in output.

- Configure does not check for memset function anymore

- to_dst_x and to_dst_y are now correct


CHANGES SINCE 0.9.0

- Added --border option

- Fixed buffer overrun bug when using big output dimensions

- Minor code cleanup

- Note that to_dst_x and to_dst_y in code might be wrong... :p
