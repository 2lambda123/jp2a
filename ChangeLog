CHANGES SINCE 0.9.14
- Minor code cleanup.  A bit faster code.
- Minor code optimization, only marginally faster (might be removed later).
- Changes to make code clearer has led to output images not being 100% exact as before,
  but the difference is negligible.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.13
- Minor bugfix: --chars now correctly accepts minimum two chars.
- Changed package layout (added src/ and tests/).
- Added `make test' target.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.12
- Bugfix: Fixed bug when viewing several files (in clear(), yadds wasn't completely cleared)
- Minor code cleanup.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.11
- Some Linux build failed on this:  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, NULL);
  This has been removed, and works well for the Linux distro tested on.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.10
- New feature:  Can now download images from URLs (requires libcurl)
- New feature:  Added --debug (-d) for debug output with libcurl
- configure:    Added --enable-curl and --with-curl-config=PATH

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.9
- Using both --width and --height is equivalent to using --size
- Now correctly calculates width and height if one of --width or --height is used

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.8
- New feature: Added --flipx and --flipy options to flip the output image.
- New feature: Added --html and --html-fontsize for XHTML 1.0 output.
- Bugfix: The bugfix from 0.9.6 sneaked back into the 0.9.8 release, and is now removed.
- Code changes: The code is a little bit cleaner, and faster now for big output dimensions
- Added reference to The Independent JPEG Group in the man page, as the libjpeg license requires that.
- The help text now fits inside 80 characters in width.
- Default mode changed from --width=70 to --width=78

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.7
- Minor portability issues resolved (regarding size_t usage)
- Moved some redundant help text to the man page
- Updated and expanded man page

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.6
- Minor bugfix, for some images, the last output line would be a "black" line,
  this has been fixed with the use of ROUND in dst_y calculations.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.5
- Fixed a major bug in the clear() function that overwrote the yadds buffer.
  The program should work much better now, especially on multiple input files.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.4
- The option --border can now be specified simply as -b
- New option --invert or -i to invert output image

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.3
- jp2a now exits with error when no files are specified
- Function signatures changed; added const where applicable
- Reintroduced use of malloc
- Added check for alloca in configure.ac

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.2
- When reading multiple files, malloc complained when freeing memory.  Using
  alloca now instead, which does not complain (although it may seem a buffer
  overrun is lurking somewhere).
- Not using exit(), using return codes.  If error occurs, we always stop.
- Using `cat file.jpg | jp2a -' now does not print help message along with
  image.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.1
- Much better output results, due to more accurate normalization and removal of
  missing scanlines in output image.
- Default mode is now "--width=70" instead of "--size=80x25", as this preserves
  JPEG aspect ratio in output.
- Configure does not check for memset function anymore
- to_dst_x and to_dst_y are now correct

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.0
- Added --border option
- Fixed buffer overrun bug when using big output dimensions
- Minor code cleanup
- Note that to_dst_x and to_dst_y in code might be wrong
