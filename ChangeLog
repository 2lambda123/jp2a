CHANGES SINCE 0.9.1

- Much better output results, due to a better (and simpler) normalization function

- Default mode is now "--width=70" instead of "--size=80x25", as this preserves
  JPEG aspect ratio in output.

- Configure does not check for memset function anymore

- to_dst_x and to_dst_y are now correct


CHANGES SINCE 0.9.0

- Added --border option

- Fixed buffer overrun bug when using big output dimensions

- Minor code cleanup

- Note that to_dst_x and to_dst_y in code might be wrong... :p
