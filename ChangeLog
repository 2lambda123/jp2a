CHANGES SINCE 0.9.1
- Entire image is now correctly read, though with gaps, which
  show up as artifacts in output picture.  (For example when
  magnifying small JPEG pictures).  The source gaps are only in
  x-direction, all JPEG y-lines are used in calculation.
- Configure will not check for memset, as it is not used.
- Default output size is now --width=70 with aspect-calculated
  height.  This is because portrait-oriented JPEGs would look
  like landscape pictures with --size=80x25, and was confusing
  with default viewing.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.0
- Added --border option
- Fixed buffer overrun bug when using big output dimensions
- Minor code cleanup
- Note that to_dst_x and to_dst_y in code might be wrong... :p
