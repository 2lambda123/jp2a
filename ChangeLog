CHANGES SINCE 0.9.5
- None yet

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.4
- The option --border can now be specified simply as -b
- New option --invert or -i to invert output image

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.3
- jp2a now exits with error when no files are specified
- Function signatures changed; added const where applicable
- Reintroduced use of malloc
- Added check for alloca in configure.ac

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.2
- When reading multiple files, malloc complained when freeing memory.  Using
  alloca now instead, which does not complain (although it may seem a buffer
  overrun is lurking somewhere).
- Not using exit(), using return codes.  If error occurs, we always stop.
- Using `cat file.jpg | jp2a -' now does not print help message along with
  image.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.1
- Much better output results, due to more accurate normalization and removal of
  missing scanlines in output image.
- Default mode is now "--width=70" instead of "--size=80x25", as this preserves
  JPEG aspect ratio in output.
- Configure does not check for memset function anymore
- to_dst_x and to_dst_y are now correct

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.0
- Added --border option
- Fixed buffer overrun bug when using big output dimensions
- Minor code cleanup
- Note that to_dst_x and to_dst_y in code might be wrong
