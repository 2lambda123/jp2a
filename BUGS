- Some conversions look a bit different on various platforms..
- Take a look at GD lib (or gd2 lib) for reading images
- Or just use libpng, and have people use convert for other imageformats
- When using another library that converts, consider removing the jpeg-reader and using
  a png 24-bits reader instead (convert all images to png grayscale, then read those images)
