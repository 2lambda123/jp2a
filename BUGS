- Take logo-40x25-gray.jpg, as long as you use --sixe=Nx25 you will get perfect results for all widths,
  but when you change y-direction, you get errors... this means y-scaling is imperfect and has to be
  corrected.  Same with jp2a logo-80x50-gray.jpg --size=Nx50

  This may be due to the fact that when traversing JPEG in y-direction, some destination scanlines
  will be written to MANY times, so the normalization function will normalize entire image, while
  in fact some dst-lines have been added to many times..

  Solution: make added_to_y buffer that contains number of times youve added to y-dir...
  When normalize, divide each scanline by corresponding value.
