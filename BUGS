TODO
- Check j2pa --color ~/tmp/cola.jpg, should not get blue color there, because we are using grayscale colors!
- Consider using Bresenham scaling (search for "Image scanling with Bresenham" on DDJ.com)
- Consider using other libs for image conversions, e.g. would be nice to read GIF and PNG.  (See libpng, gdlib.)

BUGS
- Using --term-fit and multiple files, the fit only works for the first image.
- Floating-point calculation (and rounding) is not 100% equal from compiler to compiler.  Try to fix this.
