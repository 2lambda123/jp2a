- Resizing source jpeg to BIGGER output is platform-independent, whilst downsizing jpeg to smaller
  sizes is _not_ platform independent.
- Take a look at GD lib (or gd2 lib) for reading images
- Or just use libpng, and have people use convert for other imageformats
- When using another library that converts, consider removing the jpeg-reader and using
  a png 24-bits reader instead (convert all images to png grayscale, then read those images)
