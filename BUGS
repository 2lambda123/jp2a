SUGGESTIONS
- Read all source pixels in process_scanline.  Better conversions, but a bit slower.
- Consider using Bresenham scaling (search for "Image scanling with Bresenham" on DDJ.com)
- Consider using other libs for image conversions, e.g. would be nice to read GIF and PNG.  (See libpng, gdlib.)

BUGS
- Some conversions are not 100% equal across platforms.  Investigate this (maybe it has something to do with floating point precision?)
- Using --term-fit will in some rare cases miss the space for the commandline prompt.
