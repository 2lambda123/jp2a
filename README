Installation
------------

Look in your system's package manager. I don't maintain Windows binaries
anymore.

Building
--------

If you want to compile from source, you need autotools and automake. You may
need to specify the path to jpeglib. I usually just do

    autoreconf -vi
    ./configure --with-jpeg-prefix=/usr/local \
                --with-curl-config=`which curl-config`
    make -j

Before installing, you may want to check that jp2a works by running `src/jp2a`
on some `.jpg` files. The `check` target is currently broken, and won't help
you. When you're ready to install,

    make -j install

jp2a depends on jpeglib. If configure can't automatically find it, specify with

    ./configure --with-jpeg-include=PATH --with-jpeg-lib=PATH

or you can just type the prefix

    ./configure --with-jpeg-prefix=/usr/local/

You can also compile jp2a with libcurl, so it can automatically download images
from the net:

    ./configure --enable-curl

This will look for `curl-config' in $PATH, but you can specify it directly with
--with-curl-config=PATH if you need to.

Windows
-------

You need a working jpeglib for Windows and set up include paths yourself.
You will need to manually type out a `config.h` file. Example:

    WIN32
    NDEBUG
    _CONSOLE
    PACKAGE_STRING=\"jp2a x.x.x-win32\"
    PACKAGE_BUGREPORT=\"csl@csl.name\"
    HAVE_STRING_H
    HAVE_STDLIB_H
    FEAT_CURL
    HAVE_CURL_CURL_H
    CURL_STATICLIB
    FEAT_TERMLIB

You need to add jpeg.lib to the linker. If you want libcurl support, you need
that as well. It should be available from http://curl.haxx.se
