    ABOUT JP2A

    jp2a is a simple JPEG to ASCII viewer.


    COPYRIGHT

    jp2a is Copyright (c) 2006 Christian Stigen Larsen
    Distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 or later.

    The latest version is available from http://jp2a.sf.net


    QUICK INSTALL

    ./configure
    make
    make test     # optional
    make install

    If configure doesn't find jpeglib.h and you know where
    it is, you specify with

    ./configure --with-jpeg-include=PATH --with-jpeg-lib=PATH

    If you want to be able to download images from the net, you
    must have libcurl installed (http://curl.haxx.se) and configure
    for example like this:

    ./configure --enable-curl

    This will look for `curl-config' in $PATH, but you can specify
    it directly with --with-curl-config=PATH if you need to.


    PRE-REQUISITES

    jp2a requires jpeglib.  If you don't have it, the source is
    available from http://www.ijg.org/

    If you want to be able to download images from the net, you
    also need libcurl, from http://curl.haxx.se


    BUILDING ON MAC OS X

    jp2a is now part of darwin ports, so the easiest installation is:

    sudo port install jp2a

    If you do not have darwinports installed, go to http://www.opendarwin.org
    and install it from there.

    To build yourself, do this:

    # USING FINK
    fink install libjpeg curl
    ./configure --with-jpeg-prefix=/sw --with-curl-config=/sw/bin

    # USING DARWIN PORTS
    sudo port install jpeg curl
    ./configure --with-jpeg-prefix=/opt/local --with-curl-config=/opt/local/bin


    BUILDING WITHOUT USING CONFIGURE

    You need (at least) jpeglib.h and libjpeg, then you do this:

    gcc -g -O2 \
	-DPACKAGE_BUGREPORT='"csl@sublevel3.org"' \
	-DPACKAGE_STRING='"jp2a 0.9.xx"' \
	-I/opt/local/include/ -L/opt/local/lib -l jpeg jp2a.c -o jp2a


    BUILDING ON WINDOWS (MS VISUAL STUDIO)
    
    Download a reasonable jpeglib version for Windows, e.g. from
    
    http://www.ece.sunysb.edu/~cvl/e358/f2001/jpeg-windows.html

    (Don't use Gnuwin32's version, it completely broke on my system).
    
    Fire up MS Visual Studio, you should select C++ compilation, because
    (at least with my setup) the C compiler gave some extremely strange
    warnings.
    
    Since config.h is not there, you need to add defines:
    
    PACKAGE_STRING=\"jp2a x.x.x-win32\"
    PACKAGE_BUGREPORT=\"csl@sublevel3.org\"
    
    Add the jpeg.lib file provided by above URL in the search directory
    and in the linker input, and then everything should compile without
    any errors.

    BUILDING ON WINDOWS (MINGW32)

    Using mingw32 is straight-forward if you have a working (non-MSVC)
    jpeglib.  You do something along these lines:

    ./configure --host=i386-mingw32
    make test
